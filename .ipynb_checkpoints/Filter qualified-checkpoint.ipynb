But if there's one piece of advice that worked for me, it’s this -Stop trying to have every trending skill on your resume and instead focus on mastering one: DSA.Almost every interview I’ve had included coding rounds. While AI/ML can be a great addition, but without a strong foundation in DSA, you might not even make it to the interviews.To help you build that strong foundation in DSA, here are IIIT-Hyderabad alumni who’ve worked with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon who’ll help you master DSA.

      " Do you need to master all of DSA, AI/ML and Development to land a job now?With the rise of AI, ML, and DSA, I used to feel that too. But if there's one piece of advice that worked for me, it’s this -Stop trying to have every trending skill on your resume and instead focus on mastering one: DSA.Almost every interview I’ve had included coding rounds. While AI/ML can be a great addition, but without a strong foundation in DSA, you might not even make it to the interviews.To help you build that strong foundation in DSA, here are IIIT-Hyderabad alumni who’ve worked with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon who’ll help you master DSA. They’ve also represented India in ACM-ICPC! 🇮🇳They only shortlist top-50 applicants across India, so it’ll also be a peer learning experience like no other.Apply here- https://bit.ly/3yNoTJN hashtag#dsa hashtag#coding hashtag#nirf hashtag#graphs hashtag#dp hashtag#java hashtag#cpp hashtag#software\n",
