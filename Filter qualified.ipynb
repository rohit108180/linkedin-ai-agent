      " 🚀 Just Completed Another Milestone in My Learning Journey! 🚀I'm thrilled to share that I've completed the Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask course, the 7th course in the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering learning path on Coursera. This course was a game-changer, deepening my understanding of Python and empowering me to develop and deploy AI applications with Flask.🔍 Key Learnings:1. Python Coding Practices & Packaging Concepts: - Mastered essential Python coding practices, including static code analysis and unit testing.  - Learned about Python modules, packages, and libraries, ensuring that my code is efficient, organized, and easily reusable.2. Web Application Deployment Using Flask: - Gained hands-on experience with Flask, developing basic web applications and understanding crucial concepts like routes, response/request objects, and error handling. - Built APIs with Flask, leveraging HTTP methods and integrating robust error handling for a seamless user experience.3. Project-Based Learning: - Created and deployed two projects, including an Emotion Detection Application using embeddable AI libraries.  - Extracted relevant information from AI outputs, implemented comprehensive error handling, and ensured my code met PEP8 standards with a perfect 10/10 in static code analysis. - Successfully deployed the application on the web using Flask, solidifying my skills in both backend development and AI integration.🌟 Additionally, my curiosity led me to explore more about Flask through a tutorial from hashtag#CodewithHarry on YouTube, which was incredibly insightful and further enhanced my understanding.This course has significantly advanced my skills in Python, AI, and web development, positioning me to contribute effectively in future projects. I'm excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and continue my journey in the DevOps and AI space.hashtag#Python hashtag#Flask hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Learning hashtag#IBM hashtag#Coursera hashtag#PEP8 hashtag#CodewithHarry\n",

(iii) shortlists the top 30 colleges as the first wish list to hire fresh young  talent.(iv) Generally, this task starts in the month of June/July of every year in 90% of companies.(v) A few colleges are added due to their good relationship with talent acquisition, and they have also shown good results in the past by alumni students from those institutes in their company.(vi) Tapping the companies on time also decides to be on their first wish list.(vii) Active Placement Coordinator Teams always help colleges get good companies at the right time; otherwise, they are full up with their vacancies. (viii) The strong online presence of colleges on social media, such as LinkedIn, also attracts recruiters' first-time visits as a new company.(ix) If companies get a good number of students, then they generally prefer to do a drive as compared to a smaller number of students.(x) Get connected with India's largest placement coordinator's and HR team community on WhatsApp, which shares real-time information about hiring.If you're having trouble connecting with talent recruiters and HR, I'm running India's largest placement coordinator's community on WhatsApp, which helps your college get a good number of companies.

      " 🚀 Just Completed Another Milestone in My Learning Journey! 🚀I'm thrilled to share that I've completed the Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask course, the 7th course in the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering learning path on Coursera. This course was a game-changer, deepening my understanding of Python and empowering me to develop and deploy AI applications with Flask.🔍 Key Learnings:1. Python Coding Practices & Packaging Concepts: - Mastered essential Python coding practices, including static code analysis and unit testing.  - Learned about Python modules, packages, and libraries, ensuring that my code is efficient, organized, and easily reusable.2. Web Application Deployment Using Flask: - Gained hands-on experience with Flask, developing basic web applications and understanding crucial concepts like routes, response/request objects, and error handling. - Built APIs with Flask, leveraging HTTP methods and integrating robust error handling for a seamless user experience.3. Project-Based Learning: - Created and deployed two projects, including an Emotion Detection Application using embeddable AI libraries.  - Extracted relevant information from AI outputs, implemented comprehensive error handling, and ensured my code met PEP8 standards with a perfect 10/10 in static code analysis. - Successfully deployed the application on the web using Flask, solidifying my skills in both backend development and AI integration.🌟 Additionally, my curiosity led me to explore more about Flask through a tutorial from hashtag#CodewithHarry on YouTube, which was incredibly insightful and further enhanced my understanding.This course has significantly advanced my skills in Python, AI, and web development, positioning me to contribute effectively in future projects. I'm excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and continue my journey in the DevOps and AI space.hashtag#Python hashtag#Flask hashtag#AI hashtag#DevOps hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Learning hashtag#IBM hashtag#Coursera hashtag#PEP8 hashtag#CodewithHarry\n",

(iii) shortlists the top 30 colleges as the first wish list to hire fresh young  talent.(iv) Generally, this task starts in the month of June/July of every year in 90% of companies.(v) A few colleges are added due to their good relationship with talent acquisition, and they have also shown good results in the past by alumni students from those institutes in their company.(vi) Tapping the companies on time also decides to be on their first wish list.(vii) Active Placement Coordinator Teams always help colleges get good companies at the right time; otherwise, they are full up with their vacancies. (viii) The strong online presence of colleges on social media, such as LinkedIn, also attracts recruiters' first-time visits as a new company.(ix) If companies get a good number of students, then they generally prefer to do a drive as compared to a smaller number of students.(x) Get connected with India's largest placement coordinator's and HR team community on WhatsApp, which shares real-time information about hiring.If you're having trouble connecting with talent recruiters and HR, I'm running India's largest placement coordinator's community on WhatsApp, which helps your college get a good number of companies.
