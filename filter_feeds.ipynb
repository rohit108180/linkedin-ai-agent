Think of it as the great Indian tech ghar wapsi,\" Mittal said. He noted that for years, the Indian startup community was encouraged to set up bases abroad due to concerns about regulatory hurdles and the reluctance of foreign investors to fund companies domiciled in India. However, this scenario has changed dramatically. \"Yes, there were some regulatory concerns,\" Mittal acknowledged, \"and foreign investors were hesitant to invest in Indian-domiciled companies. But that has changed. Everyone talks a big game, but at the end of the day, everyone is driven by returns. If Indian markets offer better valuations, then suddenly the regulatory environment doesn\\'t seem to matter as much.\" Mittal further pointed out that while regulatory challenges were often cited as the reason for startups moving abroad, the real issue was that Indian markets were not deep or wide enough to support significant growth. Now, with Indian markets demonstrating strong momentum and robustness, many companies are making the move back to India, he said.\"It\\'s great to see this shift,\" Mittal added, \"I hope that this marks the end of the chapter where companies feel the need to be domiciled outside of India. The fact that so many are returning shows just how much the landscape has evolved.\"Looking to make an impact in the startup ecosystem?

Examples from Google's comp on levels.fyi:• New Grad - $190,209• Mid-level - $284,702• Senior - $390,286• Staff - $549,000Each promotion will grow your compensation by around $100,000 in big tech. Those increases only grow as you become more senior.Focusing on growth over your short-term comp (especially if you're early in your career) will earn you more in the long term.Therefore, go where you think you'll grow the fastest as long as the compensation difference isn't ridiculous.

Our conversation delved into the intricacies of Payment as a Service, highlighting key trends and challenges in the industry.4 Key Takeaways for us included - 💳 Domestic Payments:- Incredible advancements in domestic payment systems, including IMPS, RTGS, NEFT, and UPI, have revolutionized transactions within the same country.- NEFT has reduced transaction time from 24 hours to just 30 minutes, while UPI enables instant transfers.🌍 Cross-Border Payments:- SWIFT remains the standard, but slower due to regulations and security measures, ensuring safer international transactions.🚀 Tech Trends:- Blockchain and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are poised to bring unprecedented changes, particularly in data privacy and the distinct needs of retail vs. corporate users.🏦 Industry Resilience:- The payments industry remains a pillar of stability and resilience, driving digital economies and fostering financial inclusion even in uncertain times.Kudos to Sonu Sachdeva for simplifying complex topics with clarity and insight!

I would start with a more modern programming language, over a more traditional one. Specialization : For a software engineer, my opinion here would be that try to be a generalist software engineer before you become a specialist. If you don’t know exactly how HTTP works, going deep in to knowing intricacies of Gradient Descent wouldn’t be helpful. Hacker Mindset : Develop a hacker mindset, get comfortable with unknowns.

From analyzing ad revenue opportunities in the trillion-dollar market to developing a semi-automated template for tracking performance, each phase of the project was a puzzle piece that expanded my knowledge and skills in the industry.One of the most memorable moments was having the chance to listen to Ruth Porat, also known as \"Lady CFO,\" during her final town hall as Google\\'s CFO. Her insights and leadership were truly inspiring, and it was an honor to witness her farewell to such an impactful role.What truly made this summer exceptional was the incredible team spirit and camaraderie within the GCS Ads Finance team. From the peaceful Redwood City office to the bustling Mountain View campus, each day was filled with learning, laughter, and meaningful connections. Whether it was exploring NYC during our team offsite, biking around the beautiful campus, or participating in community service through GoogleServe, every moment added depth and richness to my experience.I’m especially thankful to my hosts, Kshitij Gupta and Vitor Coelho, and to team members Madhvi Bhatia, Yaoshan Xu, Kavin Soni, and Ziyi Z., for their guidance and support.

But may be not all companies are comfortable servicing debt or dancing to the tunes of VCs/PEs.So, they can directly go to public. Do the IPO.We are seeing abundant money flowing into equity markets these days. India is growing.But where does this money land up? We have only a limited number of listed companies. And if too much demand is created for its shares, they will get artificially overvalued.Investors need more listed companies to invest in. And what better indication of the health of economy if GENUINE SME companies can raise capital directly from retail investors.So, IPO happening of such a company is not bad at all.What is bad?The mindset of greed of retail investors. Currently, they are applying to anything and their reason is not \"investing\". They want to cash in the listing gains. They want to gamble.This is where it goes wrong.Once these folks start making losses, their confidence from market goes down.

The platform also tracks analytics. I named it Formify—a combination of \"forms\" and \"simplify,\" representing a platform that simplifies form creation.The major challenge in this project was the front-end design. It required creating a simple yet intuitive interface where users can build forms with various rating fields using drag-and-drop functionality. I used Next.js for the project, along with Supabase as the database. I also utilized Supabase\\'s authentication feature to save time. Previously, I had used Clerk, which offers excellent authentication in terms of design and usability, but it requires a custom domain for production. Since I had exhausted my free domain quota, I opted for Supabase for this project.I began by designing the system and user flow for the entire app, including the necessary schemas for Formify. I didn’t implement extensive cache management because most of the data is real-time and requires frequent fetching. However, I did use bundling to reduce the number of calls. I also used database sharding, and Supabase’s real-time features were extremely helpful in this regard. After building the front end, creating the ORM layer for the schema, and connecting the front end with the back end, I moved on to developing a JavaScript snippet. This snippet allows users to embed the form on their websites. It took some time, but I managed to complete it on schedule.Honestly, I learned a lot from this project, especially on the front end. The Figma design provided by the team was complex, with too many colours and a confusing, non-user-friendly layout. I created a similar design but applied my design principles, particularly my 70:20:10 rule, to make it more intuitive.This was my first time working on a project of this kind, so it was a valuable learning experience. The system design took some time to finalize, but I’m pleased with the outcome. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the project. I believe that even a fresher could complete a project like this in about a month because it\\'s both useful and filled with learning opportunities.\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 27, 15, 54, 28, 288914), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

It was about a mass hiring drive for the company, and I eagerly messaged them to express my interest.The response I received was both heartbreaking and disappointing: \"We are only considering candidates from top product companies.\"Fast forward to today, and the tables have turned. The same people are now reaching out to me, asking if I’m open to exploring opportunities with them. Along the way, I discovered other great companies that offer not only better salaries but also a healthier work-life balance. The idea of a \"dream company\" has faded for me.FAANG (or MAANG) companies are valuable for your learning and your resume. If you get the chance, you should take it. But remember, there are plenty of other companies out there too.The key takeaway is this :👉  If you couldn\\'t get into a certain company now, it doesn’t define your future. If you can\\'t conquer Mount Everest now, then conquer the hills around you, and eventually, you\\'ll stand on the summit one day. 👉  You’ve found the perfect organization when you strike the right balance between compensation, work-life balance, and learning opportunities.hashtag#jobs\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 27, 15, 54, 28, 311259), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

This city monastery was donated by Ubertino de' Bardi in 1442, because he attributed the fact of having had children with his wife to the prayers of the Superior of those nuns (Sister Jacopa dei Gamberini). He purchased land called the Albergaccio, between the Carmine and via dei Serragli and had the monastery built there, dedicated to Santa Monica, mother of Sant'Agostino and, in 1447, he began the construction of the church, under the patronage of the Capponi family , of which is the coat of arms in the simple façade with a fifteenth-century portal.Camilla Martelli had her first education in this monastery and in 1564 she became the lover of Cosimo I. From their union their daughter Virginia was born in 1568, whom Cosimo legitimized as his own and who married Duke Cesare d'Este at the age of eighteen. In 1570 Cosimo became a widower and married Martelli, but without giving her any noble title. Upon the death of Cosimo I, on 21 April 1574, Grand Duke Francesco I, who had ruled the state in his father's name for many years, had Camilla, his stepmother, locked up on the same night in the monastery of Murate and then in that of Santa Monaca, where she died in 1590.In the 16th century the building was extensively remodeled, especially with the reconstruction of the altar (with the altarpiece of the Deposition by Giovanni Maria Butteri from 1583) and the choir where the nuns sat.Florence, Italyhashtag#art hashtag#culture hashtag#history hashtag#monuments hashtag#religiousbuilding hashtag#church hashtag#monastery hashtag#florence hashtag#tuscany hashtag#italy hashtag#santamonica hashtag#religiousart hashtag#photographs hashtag#interiors hashtag#renaissance hashtag#paintings hashtag#frescoes hashtag#agostinian\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 27, 15, 54, 28, 325674), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Two examples are the new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ban on fake product reviews and the DEFIANCE Act, which imposes punishments for creating and disseminating non-consensual deepfake porn. Both rules take a sensible approach to regulating AI insofar as they target harmful applications rather than general-purpose AI technology.The best way to ensure AI safety is to regulate it at the application level rather than the technology level. This is important because the technology is general-purpose and its builders (such as a developer who releases an open-weights foundation model) cannot control how someone else might use it. If, however, someone applies AI in a nefarious way, we should stop that application.Even before generative AI, fake reviews were a problem on many websites, and many tech companies dedicate considerable resources to combating them. A telltale sign of old-school fake reviews is the use of similar wording in different reviews. AI’s ability to automatically paraphrase or rewrite is making fake reviews harder to detect.Importantly, the FTC is not going after the makers of foundation models for fake reviews. The provider of an open weights AI model, after all, can’t control what someone else uses it for. Even if one were to try to train a model to put up guardrails against writing reviews, I don’t know how it could distinguish between a real user of a product asking for help writing a legitimate review and a spammer who wanted a fake review. The FTC appropriately aims to ban the application of fake reviews along with other deceptive practices such as buying positive reviews.The DEFIANCE Act, which passed unanimously in the Senate (and still requires passage in the House of Representatives before the President can sign it into law) imposes civil penalties for the creating and distributing non-consensual, deepfake porn. This disgusting application is harming many people including underage girls. While many image generation models do have guardrails against generating porn, these guardrails often can be circumvented via jailbreak prompts or fine-tuning.Again, DEFIANCE regulates an application, not the underlying technology. It aims to punish people who engage in the application of creating and distributing non-consensual intimate images, regardless of how they are generated — whether the perpetrator uses a diffusion model, a generative adversarial network, or Microsoft Paint to create an image pixel by pixel.I hope DEFIANCE passes in the House and gets signed into law. Both rules guard against harmful AI applications without stifling AI technology itself (unlike California’s poorly designed SB-1047), and they offer a good model for how the U.S. and other nations can protect citizens against other potentially harmful applications.[Original text (with links): https://lnkd.in/gcxK2A-q ]\\n', 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/gcxK2A-q': 'https://lnkd.in/gcxK2A-q'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 27, 15, 54, 28, 328715), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Instead, only a preview of the dataset is used to prevent token-related issues, and the generated code is then applied to the full dataset! 📈A big shoutout to Tejasvi Arneja just telling me the problem , which led to the idea of extending this capability to the whole dataset, making the analysis even more robust:1. Automatic Chart Creation using : Just upload your dataset (CSV or Excel), and LLaMA 3.1 now generates Python code to produce relevant charts for the entire dataset, providing comprehensive insights without any manual intervention.2.  Real-Time Execution using exec() : The generated code is executed instantly and automatically , offering real-time visualizations and insights directly in the interface.3.  Smart Feedback Loop : If an error occurs during execution, it's fed back into LLaMA, which automatically corrects the code, ensuring a smoother and more accurate analysis process—just like ChatGPT 4 and 4o feedback mechanism.4. Token Efficiency : By using only a dataset preview in the prompt, LLaMA 3.1 avoids hitting token limits, while the generated code is still applied to the full dataset for comprehensive analysis.5. User-Friendly Interaction : You can interact with LLaMA 3.1 in a conversational manner, asking it to analyze your data and create visualizations on the fly—similar to what ChatGPT-4.0 can do.This extension doesn’t just add functionality; it makes data analysis more accessible by reducing the need for coding expertise. It’s an exciting development that showcases how LLaMA can be adapted to meet specific needs, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. 💡Looking forward to exploring more ways to innovate and improve user experiences in the AI space!hashtag#Ai hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#datascience hashtag#llm #Here is a preview of how my extension works: Note : this is a hybrid approach utilizing your system with libraries to automate the process but if deployed in a cloud environment it will work the same.
