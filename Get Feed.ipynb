However, these two roles embody fundamentally different approaches to management and influence. Understanding the distinction between a boss and a leader can significantly impact both individual and organizational success.hashtag#The Boss: Authority by PositionA boss is someone who holds a position of authority within a company or organization. This role is typically defined by a formal title, such as manager, director, or supervisor. The boss\\'s primary focus is on maintaining control, ensuring that tasks are completed, and that rules are followed. Here’s what typically characterizes a boss:1. **Command and Control:** A boss often relies on their authority to get things done. They issue orders, expect compliance, and may not welcome dissent or alternative viewpoints. 2. **Focus on Tasks:** Bosses are usually task-oriented. Their priority is meeting deadlines, hitting targets, and ensuring that the team\\'s output aligns with organizational goals.3. **Micromanagement:** Bosses may engage in micromanagement, closely overseeing every aspect of their team\\'s work. This can create a rigid work environment where creativity and initiative are stifled.4. **Transactional Relationships:** The relationship between a boss and their team is often transactional. Employees perform their duties in exchange for compensation, with little emphasis on personal development or team cohesion.hashtag#The Leader: Influence by InspirationIn contrast, a leader is someone who inspires and motivates others to achieve their best, regardless of their official title. Leadership is less about authority and more about influence. Here’s what sets a leader apart:1. **Empowerment and Trust:** Leaders empower their team members by trusting them to take ownership of their work. They encourage autonomy, allowing employees to make decisions and learn from their experiences.2. **Focus on People:** Leaders are people-oriented. They understand that a team’s success is driven by the well-being and development of its members. Leaders invest time in mentoring, coaching, and supporting their employees.3. **Visionary Thinking:** Leaders have a clear vision for the future and inspire their team to work towards it. They are innovative and open to new ideas, fostering a culture of creativity and continuous improvement.hashtag#ConclusionIn essence, the difference between a boss and a leader is one of mindset and approach. A boss relies on their position to command respect, while a leader earns respect through their actions and relationships. As organizations evolve, the need for true leadership becomes increasingly important. By cultivating leadership qualities, anyone in a position of authority can transition from being a boss to becoming a leader, driving not only results but also positive change within their teams.\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 757001), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Facing this loss while beginning business school was incredibly challenging, but the GSB provided a uniquely supportive environment.🎓 10/10 Recommend Stanford was the biggest dream of my adult life, and after years of hard work to get in, I can say it was absolutely worth it—the experience of a lifetime. The GSB gave me lifelong friends, invaluable lessons, a deeper understanding of myself and my potential, and the skills to drive the changes I want to see in the world, particularly in mental health 🧠💗💪 Finding Support and CommunityWhile I lost my #1 cheerleader, Josh, I gained hundreds more—people who lifted me up and helped me grow in ways I never imagined. \\U0001f979 For example, the Veterans Club's tribute to my brother on Veterans Day was particularly meaningful, honoring his service in Iraq and showing the depth of care within the community.🎖️🌟 Leadership and Community InvolvementLeading the Hispanic Business Student Association (HBSA) and hosting our record-breaking annual gala\\xa0was all about celebrating our familia of amazing alums. Gracias a tod@s. 💡My passion for behavioral health led me to co-found the university-wide Mental Health Innovation Club, bringing together students from diverse fields to address this crisis. Building this interdisciplinary community reflects my belief in taking a holistic approach to one of our time's most pressing challenges.🤝Connections with Cooks, Cashiers, and Cleaning staffThe connections I've formed across the Stanford GSB community have been incredibly rewarding. Having grown up in Bakersfield, CA, where supporting farm worker 👩\\u200d🌾 rights was integral to my upbringing, I’ve always felt a deep respect for those who work tirelessly behind the scenes.Beyond my professors and peers, my relationships with the cashiers 💸, cooks🧑\\u200d🍳and cleaning staff🧽 were particularly special. They provided me with emotional support and invaluable insights during my Impact Design Immersion Fellowship (IDIF), where I dedicated last summer to exploring mental health entrepreneurship, including a Medicaid-focused initiative. Their voices broaden my perspective and reinforced the importance of bringing innovation to those who need it most 🏥🌟Biggest Lesson: OWN IT 🌟I discovered that my vulnerability is not a weakness but a powerful tool for authentic leadership. Touchy Feely taught me to OWN it, while Paths to Power showed me HOW to use it to influence and inspire change.

As an interviewer, it\\'s our job to look for important strengths. It is not our job to find people who would choose the topics we would choose.As an interviewer, if I approach a certain topic and find a weakness, as in the candidate just can\\'t provide good answers, then that\\'s on the candidate.If I approach 5 topics and the candidate is weak in 4 or 5 of them, I\\'m gonna fail them.What I\\'m NOT gonna do is take a candidate who was reasonably strong in 4/5 topics I brought up, and then fault THEM for not bringing up some other topics I wanted to hear about. Yet, many interviewers do that. Many interviewers just let you take the conversation to places they\\'re not interested in. By the end of the interview, the candidate wasted most of your time talking about stuff the interviewer didn\\'t care about. Sometimes it\\'s worse, sometimes, the interviewer even asks follow-up questions in an area of conversation they\\'re not interested in, just because they don\\'t wanna be \"Awkward.\"I had an interviewee recently misunderstand me. During a systems design round, he started talking about epics and stories and jira. I didn\\'t let him get 20 seconds into that before I interrupted him and told him we needed to stick to the technical.That\\'s no foul on the interviewee\\'s part. But many interviewers would have allowed the guy to continue talking about jira for 8 minutes, then go to the debrief and be all like \"I didn\\'t get any data on any strengths, thumbs down on this candidate.\"If you get an interviewer like that, you\\'re pretty screwed.All of this it to say, remember this:An interview where you failed to get an offer is not a reflection of your value as an engineer. It is merely a reflection of your skill as an interviewee and your interviewer\\'s skill as an interviewer.That is all. Great engineers fail interviews with awful interviewers. One of my mentors failed an interview I referred him to because he got interviewed by a 25 year old kid who didn\\'t know sh** about interviewing.\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 774923), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

So now I am conflicted that if she tweeted this because she is enraged or is she doing it for the views.I don\\'t know And that\\'s why I don\\'t know how to react to her statement.Another thing that I want to talk about is the politicization of this whole thing.Main Political leaders staying mum who otherwise create a ruckus over the smallest issues. There is also planned vandalism to damage the crime scene.Then there are Political parties that are using this to get political mileage.

This process involves sliding a filter over each feature map channel and summarizing the features within the covered region1. Types of Pooling: - Max Pooling: This method selects the maximum value from each region of the feature map, effectively capturing the most prominent features and ensuring that the network focuses on the most significant aspects of the data. - Average Pooling: By computing the average of values in each region, average pooling provides a smoother and more generalized representation of the feature map, which can be beneficial in scenarios where detail preservation is less critical. - Min Pooling: Although less commonly used, min pooling selects the minimum value from each region, which can be useful in specific applications where the smallest features are of interest. - L2 Pooling: This technique involves taking the square root of the sum of squares of the values in each region, offering a balance between max and average pooling by considering both magnitude and distribution. - Global Pooling: Applied over the entire feature map, global pooling reduces the feature map to a single value per channel, making it particularly useful for tasks that require fixed-length outputs, such as classification.2. Key Parameters to Consider: - Filter Size and Stride: These parameters define the size of the pooling window and how it slides across the feature map. Choosing appropriate values is crucial for controlling the level of detail retained and the degree of dimensionality reduction achieved.3. Advantages of Pooling: - Dimensionality Reduction: Pooling significantly lowers the computational cost by reducing the number of parameters and operations in the network, which also helps mitigate overfitting. - Translation Invariance: By focusing on the most important features, pooling makes models more robust to variations in feature positions, enhancing their ability to generalize across different inputs.4. Disadvantages of Pooling: - Information Loss: While pooling is effective at reducing noise, it can also discard useful details, potentially impacting the model's ability to capture fine-grained information.Pooling is a powerful tool that enhances the performance of CNNs by emphasizing critical features while minimizing noise and computational complexity. Understanding these concepts is essential for optimizing deep learning models for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and beyond.hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#CNN hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AI hashtag#DataScience hashtag#FeatureExtraction\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 778587), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Not something every Jack and Jones would do given time. For example, find an interesting open-source project, take your time to understand it, start contributing small, and eventually make that big change with a wide impact.💡 Quantify your achievements.For example, change from:\"Developed a booking microservice in Spring Boot from scratch with scalability and resiliency concerns addressed\"to:\"Developed a booking microservice that serves 1 million customers around the world with an RPS of 5k/second\"or:\"End-to-end implementation of a cost optimization product that enabled the business to save more than $20M in a year.\"💡 Don\\'t throw around technical keywords everywhere in the resume. Put them under a single section, for example, \"Skills\".💡 If you\\'re an experienced professional, discard your college projects being listed in the resume (unless it\\'s something groundbreaking). Put your educational details towards the end of the resume.💡 When you explain the project(s) in the resume, always keep the HM (aka Hiring Manager) in mind. They\\'re the ones who check your resume for final screening. They need to be impressed.💡 It\\'s nearly impossible to be an expert in 10 different technologies. So, if you list them all, make sure to mention your expertise level in each of them.💡 If you have many things to add to your resume, prioritize and include only the best among them. They\\'re not going to read all the points, even if you add them all. Keep the resume as short as possible—it\\'s perfect if it fits on a single page.hashtag#resume hashtag#softwareengineer hashtag#interviews hashtag#tips hashtag#career hashtag#engineer\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 792009), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

I was a person who used to rush into relationships because I loved the idea of having someone around and not being alone.  I loved having a boyfriend, and I got attached to anyone who showed me a little bit of affection and importance. I realized pretty late in my life that it was something I wanted and not something I needed!  I was someone who constantly wanted to “fix” people and try to mold them the way I wanted them to be around me. But I ended up losing some amazing souls. It made me realize that I was too scared of being alone; I wasn’t happy with myself, and I needed external validation, especially from a man, which is why I got attached to the wrong people and hurt myself multiple times. And since then, I have been on a path of accepting myself and loving myself.  It feels lonely sometimes. I cry my eyes out, but then I get up, go in front of the mirror, and appreciate myself, and it changed my life. From constantly talking sh*t about myself to finally accepting and complimenting myself. I have stopped forcing myself to go out just because I am feeling lonely. I have started spending the weekends watching my favorite show, making food, and just staying in and chilling.  Take it from me. It's satisfying, and it's amazing. Healing that inner child changes your life; it changes the way you look at things, especially relationships.  From constantly wanting to text people to not even using my phone and completely ignoring the world for my own good,.  I do have my flaws, but I no longer victimize myself because of those flaws! It's always You vs. You, and if you aren’t happy with yourself, then you won’t be happy with someone else.- Mallika\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 803246), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Clearly India has far too many Engineers looking for IT jobs than it needs right now. :)On a more serious note, one of the biggest problem area for India right now is jobs for its burgeoning youth population. Millions of youngsters with worthless degrees and zero job skills.Yet at the other end of the spectrum, the Urban Indian Family faces a perennial shortage of skilled people to help them with simple fixes in their busy lives. I am talking about trained and professional Plumbers, Carpenters, Electricians, AC Mechanics etc.In a country with 140 Crore plus people, everybody cannot and will not have a white-collar job, sitting in an AC office and using laptops as most of us on LinkedIn do.To the desperate Indian youngsters looking for a job, I would request them to explore some of these alternative professions. There is also a massive unfulfilled demand for professional drivers, quality health care professionals, nannies for kids of Double Income couples et al. And if you are good at what you do, making a honest living should not be too difficult, at least in the metros. The trigger for this post was the Urban Company Partner who came for my son’s haircut yesterday. Professional and extremely polite. Had 4426 bookings on the app with an average rating of 4.91. If he gets only two customers a day on the Urban Company platform, he will easily make more money than the Cognizant entry level Engineer. Plus, he is his own boss and can control the hours he works.I checked on the internet and was shocked that Urban Company has only 30,000 odd service professionals working with them. My guess is that they can easily scale it to 10 times that number in Tier I Cities alone. Someday, our youngsters will get away from this obsession of a desk job preferably in a Sarkaari office. And hopefully we will have many more players like Urban Company, who will help them gain productive skills and offer them opportunities for a respectable livelihood.\\n\", 'href_map': {'Urban Company': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/urbancompany/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 803979), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

It was a good case, but I had to tell him no. This lawyer had filed a 41a motion, which meant they had a year to refile the case. So the trial wouldn't start two days later, and I'd have time to get up to speed on the case. But even with a year to prepare, too much had already happened. • The plaintiff had been deposed. • All of the treating physicians and experts had been deposed. • Discovery had closed. You can’t take that stuff back.\\xa0We could depose people again, but that would lead to potential inconsistencies that the defense could exploit later. Our firm is always taking on more cases, but because we have had some success trying cases in recent years, our selection criteria has tightened. A case having a high potential value is important, but even more than that, we want to take cases where we know we can have a substantial impact on the outcome.That means getting cases early enough. Trial lawyers tend to be idiosyncratic. We like to set cases up the way we want them from the start.\\xa0So my advice to any lawyer who refers cases (myself included) is this—Reach out early to that attorney you want to partner with on a case. You’ll have a better chance that they agree to work with you. You’ll also likely get a better result for your client.\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 815807), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

The success of any self serve developer product is directly dependent on two important factors:1. How well is the product documented?2. How active is the community around that product?If there are no ample examples and tutorials and how to\\'s for a product, companies will refrain from using it. In fact, when companies evaluate a product to do some proof of concept to consider adopting it, \"not having good documentation\" is a critical reason to reject that product. Documentation alone is not enough. You should have \"really good\" documentation that\\'s easy to follow for anyone.Great content programs offer many more benefits:1. Your product becomes more searchable via search engines.2. You start building a community around your product through content.3. You can also optimize by creating content solving user painpoints and questions that come up on forums like Reddit, Discord and GitHub for your product.4. You create an excellent and reliable content repository to integrate with a RAG pipeline to give an even better experience to people who are using your product.From my own personal experience as a developer, I have adopted and promoted technologies that are better documented over their competitors. Even if your product is superior and has more features, if a random beginner level developer cannot self navigate and start using it smoothly, it will lose to a competitor.A solid content strategy must go hand in hand with building the product. But this is often put in backlog while the core team focuses on product building. This is exactly where you can create your own opportunity to take care of their content requirements.Everyone knows the value, but very few know how to do it right. For example, some people hire content marketers or SaaS writers to setup their content pipelines but it doesn\\'t work that way.Only a developer with first hand experience, who clearly understands the painpoints and what makes a developer\\'s life easy can create good tutorials and writeups that add value and won\\'t look like some gimmicky marketing push.Above all, the writers must have hands on dev experience and should be able to write and test code themselves to create reliable content. This is an alternate career path that\\'s opening up for developers these days.\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 818798), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

So, I spent 30x more and built my own cloud 😎 Tomper Web Services (TWS) – my own private cloud infrastructure!

Scroll to the bottom of opening and send a personal note to hiring manager.2. In the same company, check if you have any connections and reach out to them for referrals.3. Reach out to atleast 10 more people who have hiring label on their profile.💡An important note: Generally people don’t reach the JD till end, but a lot of times there’s an email attached in the end where you can cold email. So have a check of that’s as well.The whole point is to get that interview by getting your profile reach to the right person/team.

Instead of asking for clarification, I hesitated. 😓I worried 😟 What if they think I’m not good enough because I don’t understand the question? So, I decided to stay quiet and try to solve the problem anyway. As you might guess, things didn’t turn out well.Looking back, I learned an important lesson from this experience: 🔹 Tough questions are opportunities to learn something new. When faced with a challenge, embrace it. These moments push you to grow, think differently, and improve your skills.🔹 Solving a problem without fully understanding it is like going on a trip without knowing your destination. Even if you’re great at what you do, solving the wrong problem won’t help.🔹 It’s normal to feel nervous about admitting you don’t know something, especially in an interview. But saying, “I don’t know,” isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s the first step toward learning something new.That’s why having the right guidance and support is so important, especially when you’re preparing for high-stakes interviews.

Kesavan Ravi Sir from Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad introduced me to multiple domains and mentored me through a research paper, igniting my passion for AI/ML applications. At National Institute of Technology Durgapur, I am deeply indebted to Supriya Bera Sir, Subrata Nandi Sir, Dakshina Ranjan Kisku Sir, Debashish Mitra Sir, and Prof. Tong Ping from Nanyang Technological University Singapore. Their referrals, advice, and continuous support have been instrumental in my success.3. Friends, Peers, and Seniors: I owe a debt of gratitude to Bidyutprabha D. for being an unwavering source of support. Special thanks also go to Dayeeta Pal, Shekhar Anand, and Dhrubajyoti Gupta. Their insights have profoundly impacted my journey and shaped the decisions that led me here. Would also thank Sourav Panda, Amrit Puhan and Sree Bhattacharyya, whose advice and encouragement were nothing short of a blessing. This milestone is more than just an academic achievement; it is a testament to the collective effort, belief, and guidance of everyone who has supported me along the way.

I attempted to attend the interview three times, and each time I faced significant technical issues with the HirePro software used for the process. Despite my efforts to overcome these problems, I encountered audio glitches and other technical challenges that made it nearly impossible to participate effectively.When I finally joined the interview on the third attempt, I was informed that a valid ID was required for verification. I provided my Aadhaar card, which is a widely accepted form of identification in India. However, I was surprised to learn that it was not accepted. This raises concerns about the consistency of your verification process.Additionally, the interviewer’s behavior was unprofessional. He appeared in casual attire and spoke to me in a harsh and rude manner, which left me questioning the professionalism of your recruitment process. Moreover, my interview was scheduled for 3:00 PM, but the interviewer only joined at 3:15 PM. This lack of punctuality resulted in the loss of 15 minutes of my scheduled time, and it seemed that no one cared about this delay.I believe it’s important to address these issues to ensure that future candidates do not face similar challenges. I hope Accenture takes this feedback seriously and works on improving both the technical aspects of the interview process and the professionalism and punctuality of the interviewers.\"\\n', 'href_map': {'Accenture': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture/', 'Accenture in India': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/accentureindia/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 17, 5, 24, 31, 860690), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

She fainted due to dehydration and had to be hospitalised. This is her picture from the hospital, where IOA President PT Usha went to meet her post her disqualification. Vinesh managed to lose almost 1.8 kgs overnight. But was still 100 grams overweight for the 50 kgs category.How did her weight increase?Her weight was 49.9 kgs before her first bout, so she was well within the permissible limit. But after 3 back-to-back wins, she gained around 2 kgs. In between bouts, it’s natural for athletes to gain weight. Their teams, including doctors and nutritionists, then take all possible efforts to reduce their weight. Some water and food also has to be given between bouts to maintain energy and strength. Dr. Pardiwala said that Vinesh was given her usual amount of 1.5 kg of high-energy food for the day. Athletes are given a set time to reduce their weight and bring it within the permissible weight. Vinesh managed to lose most of the extra weight except 100 grams.Vinesh’s intense weight cutting for the OlympicsVinesh’s natural body weight is about 56-57 kgs. She usually competed in the 53 kg category. Even that required her to lose a lot of weight. For Paris Olympics, Vinesh couldn’t make it to the 53kg category because wrestler Antim Panghal won the Olympic quota for India at the World Championships last year. Vinesh was injured and bedridden back then. She had no option but to compete in the 50 kg category. She brutally cut her weight from a natural weight of 56-57 kgs to 50 kgs. Dr. Pardiwala from IOA said that Vinesh is now physically and medically perfectly normal, but she’s disappointed to be disqualified in her 3rd Olympics.We can’t even begin to imagine the frustration Vinesh would’ve felt after not qualifying even after taking all extreme steps to reduce her weight. How she would’ve felt to be disqualified after making it to the finals, defeating the world champion, despite what all she went through in India over the last one year.And she still has a smile on her face :)The body and mind of a sportsperson is truly made of something else!

I solved the first 5 problems out of 8 and here's a very quick editorial for them.✨ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐀: Do the needful as mentioned in the problem statement.✨𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐁: Pigeonhole principle. If the last number is greater than the sum of the first two smaller numbers + 1, we cannot make the answer.✨𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐂: Let's assume that all m people lied. Then we already have 'm' wrong answers. So we need to ask at least m + 1 person who will tell us the correct answer. Hence, the answer will be (2m + 1).✨𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐃: This problem turns into the basic two-sum problem from leetcode once you find all the non-prime numbers between 1 to 200 and check for each of them using a map whether there are two numbers at two different indexes having sum non-prime.✨𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐄: The constraints on A[i] gave away the necessary information you need to solve this problem. See how A[i] <= 50 which means there could be only 250 different pairs of starting and ending indexes for the subsequence of length k. So check for all the 250 pairs and greedily choose the maximum elements first the range of the pair using a prefix count array which keeps the count of the number of array elements present in a range l to r.If you need the code, check out my CodeChef ID.

My time with Google and my team has been extremely rewarding. I\\'ve gotten a chance to work on multiple large scale projects like implementing a Business continuity plan and helping launch the IT apprenticeship program in India which has added quite a lot of skills and anecdotes to my program management repertoire as well.Here are the top 3 things I\\'ve learnt in my career so far (hoping it can be helpful to some of you too):1. Keep a learning mindset 🧠I observed this the first time in a few of my colleagues about 2 years back - even if they\\'d made a mistake executing something, they were excited to learn from it and this has changed my view of how I look at my own work completely.I now attribute much more importance to having an \"add\" mindset and look for what each experience is adding to what I already know.2. If in trouble, look at it from a generation back 👀This one is not something that everybody may agree with but something I realised from my conversations with my dad. Whenever I think I\\'m having a hard time at work, I call him and it puts into perspective how small the problem actually is (of course, that may not always be the case). It allows me to look at the situation more objectively and from both POVs.3. Be grateful 🙌This is a difficult one to practice continuously. I\\'ve had trouble doing that myself but I finally found a way that works for me and it has allowed me to accept difficult circumstances and challenges more graciously which has in turn allowed me to continue working on new things.I am very thankful to all of my colleagues and friends for being the amazing people they are.

WayUp's Top Intern - Ciara Cade, aka the leader of The Tech Cadets \\U0001fae1. Ciara is heading into her fourth year at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Science, and this summer, she interned as a Software Engineer at Uber! Prior to Uber, she was a Bloomberg Tech Lab Fellow, winner of the JPMorganChase Code for Good Hackathon, and a SWE Intern for Capital One.The Leadership Award - Joshua Schreiber. I first found Joshua's LinkedIn from his ultra-viral post about being one of the casualties of Tesla's layoffs/rescinding internship offers. Kind of a no-brainer, but he quickly got scooped up by Coinbase, where he spent this last summer as an HR Technology Intern! He's headed into his senior year at Miami University, studying Organizational Leadership. The Creative Award - Amaya Roberson, aka the host of The Intentional Intern Podcast. Amaya interned for Porsche Cars North America as an Employee Engagement intern and previously worked as a Talent Acquisition Intern at Norfolk Southern (twice) and at Nintendo as an HR Community Engagement Intern. The Influencer Award - Ume Habiba, aka THAT GIRL. Ume is one of my besties, and I connected with her for the first time at GHC23 through a Kode With Klossy meetup. She inspires me with everything she does, including (but not limited to) interning at Microsoft as a Backend SWE this summer, at Kode with Klossy doing Content, Community, and Curriculum, at Cisco Meraki as a Full-stack SWE, at JPMorganChase as a Full-stack SWE, and as an E-Commerce SWE at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.. She's also keynoted at Google and has 60K+ on Instagram.

You see every company spending huge money and hashtags hashtag#BeAnAlly hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#WomenEmpowerment hashtag#IWD2023 are being promoted on Women’s Day.Supporting Diversity and Inclusion events has become a marketing gimmick for most of the companies who tend to organize grand events on IWD , conferences , social media campaigns and what not butthey fail to realize that the idea behind bringing more women in tech should be focussing upon how can we support girl child in the initial days of her primary and secondary education.This will make her better, corporates who tend to support diversity and celebrate this day should consider spending a part of their CSR towards the education of girl Child in India, so that we don't explicitly need to look for diversity in hiring candidates. We often talk about, Women In Tech,Women In the Startup World,Women in Government Services,Women In Science, ......The contribution and diversity they bring along with diverse mindset, ideas and making workplace more safer, happier and productive is what calls for more women in tech.Diversity Hiring has been in news for reason good or bad but its crucial at the same time, why?1. Lesser number of women at higher engineering positions and leadership roles in IT Industry.2.Due to societal obligations of marriage, family, almost 50-60% women are not supposed to work, given that her husband can earn money and she takes care of her family.3.Still the social bias between a male and a female exists that makes lesser women go for higher studies.4.Also inequality and pay gap at workplace is also observed that makes the survival difficult.So along with diversity hiring Programs , companies should come up and use their CSR ( Corporate Social Responsibility ) funds to solve the problem at grassroot level :- Making Primary and Secondary education accessible for Girls in India.- Awareness Programs regarding what all lies for them in future through several initiatives.- Corporate Scholarships by these tech giants for Primary and Secondary Education of women.- “Women in Tech” who have attained that position can be the torchbearers to understand the problem and make a difference.“Fancy Titles , Big Grand Diversity Hiring Events for Marketing and Making their Hiring Processes flawed , it’s no use”Spend that money on solving the actual problem .But nevertheless, hope this answer helps and you keep the grind on.
