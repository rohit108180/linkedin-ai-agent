Instead of resorting to anger or a heated argument, this man chose a path that was both surprising and memorable.He placed his malfunctioning Ola scooter, adorned with a garland around the handle, onto a cart and wheeled it to the Ola showroom.Once there, he pulled out a microphone and began serenading the staff and onlookers with a twist on a classic Salman Khan song.He sang the famous song ‚ÄòTadap Tadap Ke‚Äô but with lyrics that conveyed his plight: ‚ÄúTadap tadap ke iss dil se aah nikalti rahi, mujhko saza di Ola ne, aisa kya gunaah kiya, to lut gaye, ha lut gaye, to lut gaye hum Ola lekar re.‚Äùhashtag#olaelectric hashtag#ola hashtag#bhilai hashtag#chattisgarh hashtag#electricscooter hashtag#ev hashtag#indianstartupnews\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 272750), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Wrong. When asked by AI tools like ChatGPT and LLaMA3, which is greater, 9.11 or 9.9, initially both answered that 9.11 is the greater. So how can AI, which is supposed to solve complex calculus problems fail at a basic second-grade maths question? The answer comes down to one word: tokenization.In the world of AI, tokenization refers to the process of breaking input text into smaller units called \"tokens.\" For example, the sentence \"I love food\" gets broken down into \"I,\" \"love,\" and \"food\". This helps AI understand human language without losing context or meaning‚Äîthough this case is an exception. The reason why it fails here is that, in some instances, all numbers after the decimal point are treated as one unit, resulting in comparing 9. ‚Äú11‚Äù to 9. ‚Äú9‚Äù and giving an incorrect answer.The good news is that AI models continuously improve through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For example, as of today, ChatGPT has corrected its mistake and now accurately identifies \\'9.9 as greater than 9.11\\'(see attached screenshot from yesterday where it mistakenly stated that \\'9.11 is greater than 9.9\\'). However, Meta\\'s AI \"LLaMA\" still incorrectly shows \\'9.11 as greater than 9.9\\'. Even though RLHF helps AI models to correct their mistakes, at the core, they still rely on pattern recognition and data processing, thus lacking true understanding and critical thinking.In conclusion, always double check your math results even if it\\'s from an AI.hashtag#ai hashtag#tech hashtag#generativeai hashtag#llm\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 277853), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

It's better to seek clarification than to make assumptions.3 Be Proactive: If you have ideas for improving processes or products, share them with your team. Startups value innovation and initiative.4 Focus on Collaboration: Startups often have small teams, so strong collaboration is crucial. Communicate clearly, be open to feedback, and work closely with your colleagues.5 Stay Flexible: Startups can change direction quickly. Be prepared to adapt to new priorities and shifts in the business landscape.6 Develop Good Coding Practices: Write clean, maintainable code, and follow best practices for code reviews, version control, and testing.7 Understand the Business: Take time to learn about the company's mission, customers, and competitors. This understanding will help you make better technical decisions.8 Build a Network: Connect with other developers in your company and in the broader tech community. Networking can help you learn new skills and find mentors.9 Manage Your Time Wisely: Startups can be intense, so it's important to manage your time effectively. Prioritize tasks and maintain a good work-life balance.10 Be Patient and Persistent: Startups can face challenges, and not everything will go as planned.

It's now one of India's most valuable fintech startups, with 1484 cr revenue in FY23.The second entrepreneur I find less talked about in positive sense is: Vijay Shekhar Sharma.> Vijay's story begins as a young man from a small town.> He struggled with the English language at Delhi College of Engineering.> He skipped classes, lived in hostels, and often did not even eat anything.> He started XS Communications but lost 40% of his initial $10,000 funding.Vijay persevered despite the early failures and still pitched the idea for Paytm while his board was skeptical.Undeterred, he took a personal financial risk. Later, Paytm became a constant in India's digital payment landscape.Even though Paytm got into regulatory challenges and Freecharge went bust, what I learned from these stories is the power of sheer determination. These two entrepreneurs didn't just bounce back from failure; they used it as a springboard to even greater success.I think it's the ultimate test for an entrepreneur. To take your biggest setback and turn it into an opportunity. In the world of startups, today's failure could be tomorrow's billion-dollar idea.Are you pushing forward despite the initial challenges?

Placements & Interviews: Having a good CGPA can help you get through the door in campus placements. Many companies use it as a way to shortlist candidates for interviews. It shows your consistency and discipline, giving employers an idea of your academic capabilities. Aim for a CGPA between 7.5 to 8.5, but if it's above 8.5, even better ‚Äì you'll have access to a lot of companies!If you want to have better clarity on CGPA for campus placements, do ask your seniors about the past placement scenario.2. Higher Education: If you're thinking about further studies, whether in India or abroad, your CGPA is important. Universities often have a minimum CGPA requirement, and a strong academic record can make it easier to get into the program you want and even secure scholarships.Scholarships play a crucial part when applying for foreign universities, and you need financial aid.3. College Life: But remember, your CGPA isn't everything. Getting involved in extracurricular activities, making connections, and gaining practical experience are just as important. These experiences help shape your personality, improve your soft skills, and prepare you for the real world.4. Balance is Key: Find the right balance between academics and personal growth. It's important to enjoy college life, make friends, and explore new things. A well-rounded approach will not only make your college life great but will also prepare you for a successful career.So, while your CGPA can open doors, it's the mix of knowledge, experience, and skills that will take you to great places!And don't forget to have fun in college ‚Äì it's all about making lifelong memories and discovering new things!Follow Krishan Kumar for more!!hashtag#collegelife\\n\", 'href_map': {'Krishan Kumar': '/in/krishan-kumar08/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 333455), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

They:‚Ä¢ create misunderstandings,‚Ä¢ damage relationships,‚Ä¢ and even destroy your career or business goals.1. Assuming Instead of AskingThe Mistake: We often assume others have the same context or understanding as we do.The Cost:‚Ä¢ Misunderstandings,‚Ä¢ missed opportunities,‚Ä¢ and damaged relationships.The Fix: Over-communicate. Ask clarifying questions. Remember, assumptions are the termites of relationships.Example: Instead of assuming a colleague is upset with you, ask, \"I noticed you\\'ve been quiet lately. Is everything okay?\"2. Listening to Respond, Not to UnderstandThe Mistake: Formulating your response while the other person is still speaking.The Cost: Missing important information and making the other person feel unheard.The Fix:‚Ä¢ Practice active listening.‚Ä¢ Focus entirely on the speaker.‚Ä¢ Paraphrase to ensure understanding.Tip: Try the 80/20 rule - listen 80% of the time, speak 20%.3. Neglecting Non-Verbal CommunicationThe Mistake: Focusing solely on words and ignoring body language, tone, and facial expressions.The Cost: Missing the full message and sending unintended signals.The Fix: Pay attention to your own body language and learn to read others\\'. Actions often speak louder than words.Fact: Studies show that up to 93% of communication is non-verbal.Lucky for us, good communication is a skill that can be learned and improved.It just requires constant practice and self-awareness.---Did you know that miscommunication can cost a company of 100 employees around $420,000 per year?I\\'m offering a FREE, no-strings-attached consultation about insights and strategies for improvement that helped 87% of my clients reduce miscommunication.Book your slot here: https://lnkd.in/ggs6uWyv---\\n', 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/ggs6uWyv': 'https://lnkd.in/ggs6uWyv'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 344835), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

The client(browser) gets the html javascripts and starts rendering the page by fetching the required components. This is generally called client-side rendering. But, this has a lot of issues with it so a lot of websites shift towards server-side rendering.1. Server Side Rendering(SSR) is a technique used to improve the performance of JavaScript templating systems (such as React). Rather than waiting for the client to download a JavaScript bundle and render the page based on its contents, we render the page‚Äôs HTML on the server side and attach dynamic hooks on the client side once it‚Äôs been downloaded.2. Let‚Äôs take an example of how yelp does this. Yelp prepares components for SSR by bundling them with an entrypoint function and any other dependencies into a self-contained .js file. The entrypoint then uses ReactDOMServer, which accepts component props and produces rendered HTML. These SSR bundles are uploaded to S3.3. On startup, yelp followed a strategy in which they would download and initialize the latest version of every SSR bundle for each page and then according to the request from the user the page would be loaded.4. But, this posed a lots of issues: 1. Downloading and initializing every bundle significantly increased service startup time, which made it difficult to quickly react to scaling events. 2. Having the service manage all bundles created a massive memory requirement. Every time a new instance came up, memory equal to sum of all bundles would have to be allocated. 3. If a new version of a bundle was uploaded in between service restarts, the service wouldn‚Äôt have a copy of it. 5. The above problems are quite common problems if you are doing server-side rendering for your websites. To solve the above problems, Yelp followed the following strategy: 1.\\xa0Shard service instances by bundle, so that each bundle has its own unique resource allocation. This reduces our overall resource footprint and makes bundle-specific performance easier to observe. 2.\\xa0Use an LRU cache to ensure too many dynamic bundles were not present in memory at the same time. 3. Be able to fast-fail requests which is not anticipated to be served quickly. If it is known that it‚Äôll take a long time to render a request, the system should immediately fall back to client-side rendering.For more tech content: https://lnkd.in/gz_M6yrf\\n', 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/gz_M6yrf': 'https://lnkd.in/gz_M6yrf'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 365046), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

But what exactly are they, and how can we navigate through this tough phase?What Are Silent Layoffs?Silent layoffs occur when companies gradually reduce their workforce without making public announcements. This can happen through various means:- Reduced Hours: Your work hours are cut back without any clear reason.- No New Projects: You stop getting assigned new tasks or projects.- Isolation: You notice you‚Äôre left out of important meetings and decisions.- Performance Pressure: Unreasonable targets are set, making it hard to meet expectations.How to Overcome Silent Layoffs1. Acknowledge Your Feelings: It‚Äôs okay to feel lost, hurt, or anxious. This is a tough situation, but remember, you are not alone.2. Self-Reflection: Take a step back and assess your skills and achievements. What have you accomplished so far? This can boost your confidence.3. Upgrade Your Skills: Use this time to learn new things. There are many free online courses available that can help you upskill.4. Network: Connect with peers and professionals in your industry. Attend virtual events and join LinkedIn groups.5. Seek Support: Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for help. Talk to friends, family, or a career coach. Mental health is crucial during such times.6. Stay Positive: Remember, this phase doesn‚Äôt define your worth. Every setback is a setup for a comeback. Believe in yourself and stay resilient.Silent layoffs are a challenging experience, but they are just a phase. There is nothing wrong with you. It‚Äôs the market, not your capabilities.Keep pushing forward, stay connected, and continue to grow. Better opportunities are on the horizon.Remember, you are strong, and this too shall pass. üåü\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 395223), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

It emphasizes that interfaces should be small, specific, and focused on particular responsibilities. Classes should not be forced to implement methods they do not need.Key Idea:Avoid \"fat\" interfaces. Instead of creating large, all-encompassing interfaces, divide them into smaller, more specialized ones.Example:A multifunction printer interface that combines printing, scanning, faxing, and copying into one interface would violate ISP.

Re-sharing for those applying in this admissions cycle. I got admission to the University of Oxford not once, but twice. The first time, I did not get to go due to lack of funding, and unfortunately, had to withdraw my applications. The second time round, I was fortunate to receive two full scholarships - the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Trust Scholarship and the Chevening Awards Scholarship to study at Oxford. So, what are the lessons from my experience of securing a scholarship at Oxford? How did I change my strategy between the first (unsuccessful) attempt and the second (successful) attempt at securing admission and two scholarships at Oxford?\\xa0Here are four lessons: a) ùóîùóª ùó≤ùóæùòÇùóÆùóπ ùó≥ùóºùó∞ùòÇùòÄ ùóºùóª ùó∞ùóºùòÇùóøùòÄùó≤ ùóÆùó±ùó∫ùó∂ùòÄùòÄùó∂ùóºùóªùòÄ ùóÆùóªùó± ùòÄùó∞ùóµùóºùóπùóÆùóøùòÄùóµùó∂ùóΩùòÄ ‚Äì in my second application cycle, I prioritised scholarships. This meant spending significantly more time in searching for and applying to scholarships. Scholarships were no longer the secondary (or last-minute) application to be considered after securing admission to the course. I thought about them in parallel and also prioritised the course based on the funding that could be secured. b) ùóîùóΩùóΩùóπùòÜùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùó≥ùóºùóø ùó∫ùóºùóøùó≤ ùòÅùóµùóÆùóª ùóºùóªùó≤ ùòÄùó∞ùóµùóºùóπùóÆùóøùòÄùóµùó∂ùóΩ ‚Äì in my first application cycle, I had only applied to a few full scholarships, but in the second instance, I cast a wider net. I applied for smaller scholarship amounts which I knew would not cover the entire course fees but would help cover some of it. Smaller scholarships also gave me practice in developing answers and preparing for the interviews of the full scholarships. c) ùó†ùóÆùó∂ùóªùòÅùóÆùó∂ùóªùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóÆ ùòÄùó∞ùóµùóºùóπùóÆùóøùòÄùóµùó∂ùóΩ ùòÅùóøùóÆùó∞ùó∏ùó≤ùóø ‚Äì in my second application cycle, I prepared a broader calendar marking the important scholarship deadlines and updated a weekly planner that had detailed tasks for the next scholarship deadline. This helped have a sense of the broader picture of deadlines, while focussing more sharply on the detailed documentation to be fulfilled for each scholarship. This also helped to keep a track of deadline extensions, and new funding opportunities. d) ùó®ùóªùó±ùó≤ùóøùòÄùòÅùóÆùóªùó±ùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóÆùòÄùó∏ ùóºùó≥ ùó≤ùóÆùó∞ùóµ ùòÄùó∞ùóµùóºùóπùóÆùóøùòÄùóµùó∂ùóΩ ‚Äì in my second application cycle, I focussed more keenly on the ask of each scholarship-granting institution. Each scholarship has its own principles and values and will tend to award the candidates who embody them. For instance, some scholarships may be focussed on academic merit, while others may emphasise upon leadership skills. I calibrated the essays for each scholarship accordingly ‚Äì I scouring the websites of scholarships, stressed upon key words, and made sure that my essays addressed the questions being posed by the scholarship bodies.

AI Python for Beginners is a series of four short courses that teach anyone to code, regardless of current technical skill. We are offering these courses free for a limited time.Generative AI is transforming coding. This course teaches coding in a way that‚Äôs aligned with where the field is going, rather than where it has been:(1) AI as a Coding Companion: Experienced coders are using AI to help write snippets of code, debug code, and the like. We embrace this approach and describe best-practices for coding with a chatbot. Throughout the course, you'll have access to an AI chatbot that will be your own coding companion that can assist you every step of the way as you code.(2) Learning by Building AI Applications: You'll write code that interacts with large language models to quickly create fun applications to customize poems, write recipes, and manage a to-do list. This hands-on approach helps you see how writing code that calls on powerful AI models will make you more effective in your work and personal projects.With this approach, beginning programmers can learn to do useful things with code far faster than they could have even a year ago.Knowing a little bit of coding is increasingly helping people in job roles other than software engineers. For example, I've seen a marketing professional write code to download web pages and use generative AI to derive insights; a reporter write code to flag important stories; and an investor automate the initial drafts of contracts.With this course you‚Äôll be equipped to automate repetitive tasks, analyze data more efficiently, and leverage AI to enhance your productivity.If you are already an experienced developer, please help me spread the word and encourage your non-developer friends to learn a little bit of coding.I hope you'll check out the first two short courses here! https://lnkd.in/g7VB9t2P\\n\", 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/g7VB9t2P': 'https://lnkd.in/g7VB9t2P'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 432287), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

I thought about it, so I put together a system design to help him visualize how it could be done with a better approach.I've divided the quiz app into three main types:1. Offline Mode: Using a SQLite database or even a simple JSON file.2. Online Mode: Leveraging an online database like MongoDB, Supabase, or similar.3. Quiz app with create feature with leaderboard: A quiz app that allows users to create quizzes with a live leaderboardThe primary idea behind this system is to efficiently manage quiz data. Whether the quiz is sourced online or user-generated, the system caches the quiz data to minimize repeated API calls. For instance, if there are 10 quiz sets within a particular category, the system stores them in a cache, serving them randomly to users without having to fetch them again and again. This not only optimizes performance but also enhances the user experience. Of course, this can be adjusted based on specific needs and use cases.This design is outlined in three main approaches to offer flexibility in how the app can be developed. While a quiz app might sound simple, there‚Äôs a lot of potential to make it a robust and scalable project. I also considered ideas like implementing a multiplayer mode, but for someone in their second year, it might be a bit too advanced at this stage, so I set that aside for now.I‚Äôd love to hear any thoughts or additional ideas on this.

The repeated failure to meet these basic expectations is frustrating, to say the least.I‚Äôm sharing this experience not just to vent, but to highlight the importance of accountability and proper customer service. Companies like Uber must do better.Uber, I hope you see this and take immediate action to investigate and resolve this issue, not just for me, but for all your customers who trust your service daily.Uber Uber Engineering hashtag#ubersucks(Attached is a screenshot of the incident for reference.)\\n', 'href_map': {'Uber': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/uber-com/', 'Uber Engineering': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/uberengineering/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 434589), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

The cost was non-trivial, but the bigger problem was that most of the spending was wasted.The function performed a CPU-intensive task, so the team gave it the full 10GB of memory, hoping to boost its performance.But this was a Node.js function.As Node.js is single threaded, it only uses 1 CPU core unless you spawn child processes. So the client wasn't utilizing the 6 vCPUs that they got from the 10GB memory allocation.The workload didn't need all that memory either, so most of what they paid for was wasted.It's an innocent mistake and one that's far less common than underpowered functions, but it was very impactful.Lambda gives you a single lever to control performance and cost. I like the simplicity of it, more memory = more CPU. But it's also easy to get things wrong by an order of magnitude, and sometimes you just need more CPU without all the extra memory too.Before you rage against serverless, this costly, one-liner config mistake can also happen to container workloads.A misconfigured instance size or min auto-scaling count would do just much damage. At least the cost here is tied to the actual usage (it's a fairly busy function) and not idle servers doing nothing. I've worked in places that easily spent $10,000+/month for dev servers that averaged 5% CPU...Luckily, there are tools to address this kind of problem, but you still need to know about and use them.There's the Lambda Powertuning tool, which requires some effort on your part to proactively tune every function.There's also the AWS Compute Optimizer, which you can just opt-in to receive recommendations. But it might take a while to get recommendations because Compute Optimizer only shares recommendations when it has high confidence in them.But to complicate things, if you have a Lambdalith, then these optimizers also don't work very well, because your function can do many different things and exhibit drastically different performance characteristics. Something to keep in mind when you settle for a Lambdalith.\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 435386), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

This means it can forecast the evolution and structure of storms with greater accuracy and speed than traditional methods, helping meteorologists track severe events like tornadoes and hurricanes. The model is part of NVIDIA's Earth-2 platform, which combines AI, physical simulations, and computer graphics to create a digital twin of the planet that can simulate and visualize weather and climate predictions at a global scale. With StormCast, researchers can predict future outcomes based on past ones, enabling more reliable disaster planning and mitigation. This breakthrough is part of a larger effort to use AI and accelerated computing to improve climate research and prediction, which is crucial for saving lives and reducing the impact of extreme weather events that cause over $150 billion in damage annually in the US alone.Source üîó: https://lnkd.in/grVj_umTCurated with ‚ù§Ô∏è via https://lnkd.in/dAQMAegz, aggregating 150+ hashtag#tech blogs on a single feed! ‚ú®Subscribe to Techflix Daily: https://lnkd.in/gDnfiRrb\\n\", 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/grVj_umT': 'https://lnkd.in/grVj_umT', 'https://lnkd.in/dAQMAegz': 'https://lnkd.in/dAQMAegz', 'https://lnkd.in/gDnfiRrb': 'https://lnkd.in/gDnfiRrb'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 447139), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

For example, instead of typing `git status`, you can create an alias like `gs` to quickly check the status of your repository. üõ†Ô∏è Add aliases to your `.gitconfig` file for a more efficient workflow. ``` git config --global alias.gs status git config --global alias.co checkout ```2Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Add: Want to stage changes selectively? Use `git add -p` (or `git add --patch`) to interactively choose which changes to stage. This is perfect for splitting changes into multiple commits and keeping your history clean. üì¶ ``` git add -p ```3Ô∏è‚É£ Stash: Need to switch branches but have uncommitted changes? Use `git stash` to save your changes temporarily. When you‚Äôre ready, apply the stash with `git stash apply` to bring your changes back. It‚Äôs a lifesaver for managing work-in-progress! üåü ``` git stash git stash apply ```4Ô∏è‚É£ Rebase: Keep your commits organized and your history clean with `git rebase`. Rebase allows you to apply commits from one branch onto another, making your feature branches easier to manage and integrate. Remember to use `rebase` carefully to avoid conflicts. üß© ``` git rebase main ```By incorporating these Git tips into your workflow, you‚Äôll streamline your development process and maintain a cleaner codebase. üí™Got any favorite Git tips or tricks?

Step Up Social originally started as a TikTok-only agency, making TikToks while Instagram wasn‚Äôt pushing Reels and YouTube Shorts weren‚Äôt even a thing yet. Short-form content was not super popular, and it wasn‚Äôt being prioritized. At that time, TikTok marketing was a nice-to-have, something brands only considered if they happened to have extra marketing budget. We were like a vitamin or a supplement to potential clients - nice to have but not really a necessity.But then, the algorithms got flipped upside down, and the landscape of social media practically changed overnight. Instagram started to push and prioritize Reels, and YouTube came out with Shorts. We evolved from being just a TikTok agency to a full-suite social media management company. Suddenly, we didn‚Äôt just do TikToks; we did Instagram Reels, Meta Reels and YouTube Shorts. We went back and revisited clients who had previously said no to our ‚Äújust TikTok‚Äù offerings, and the many of them changed their minds.We had already been doing short-form content for such a long time. This seemingly simple social media algorithm change transformed us from a ‚Äúvitamin‚Äù into a ‚Äúpainkiller,‚Äù making our services essential for any business who wanted to get reach on social platforms.Did we know that social media platforms would make this change? Nope. But we were incredibly well-positioned for it since we already had a great portfolio of short-form content and the clientele to prove it. You could say we were in the right place at the right time or that we had good foresight.But at the end of the day, working in the social media space means being beholden to the whims and changes of the major social media platforms. Always be ready to adapt and pivot quickly. üöÄ**Key Takeaway:** Adaptability and seizing new opportunities can transform your business from a nice-to-have service into a must-have solution.\\n', 'href_map': {'Step Up Social': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/stepupsocial/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 476263), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

One powerful way to differentiate yourself is to solve in public. Share your learning journey, challenges, and growth on platforms like GitHub and Twitter (especially if you're into development). Don't just post code, explain your approach, your understanding, and the lessons learned along the way. Also, use LinkedIn to showcase your projects and experiences. This isn't just about getting likes, it's about visibility and creating opportunities. The more you share, the more you increase your chances of being noticed by potential employers and collaborators.
