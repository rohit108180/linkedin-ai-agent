Instead of resorting to anger or a heated argument, this man chose a path that was both surprising and memorable.He placed his malfunctioning Ola scooter, adorned with a garland around the handle, onto a cart and wheeled it to the Ola showroom.Once there, he pulled out a microphone and began serenading the staff and onlookers with a twist on a classic Salman Khan song.He sang the famous song ‘Tadap Tadap Ke’ but with lyrics that conveyed his plight: “Tadap tadap ke iss dil se aah nikalti rahi, mujhko saza di Ola ne, aisa kya gunaah kiya, to lut gaye, ha lut gaye, to lut gaye hum Ola lekar re.”hashtag#olaelectric hashtag#ola hashtag#bhilai hashtag#chattisgarh hashtag#electricscooter hashtag#ev hashtag#indianstartupnews\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 272750), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

The more you know, the more valuable you become.2️⃣ Build Your Network: 🤝 Connect with people in your field. Networking can open doors you never knew existed.3️⃣ Side Projects: 💻 Showcase your skills with personal projects that solve real problems. They demonstrate your passion and initiative to potential employers and are a great way to learn and apply new skills.4️⃣ Interview Practice: 🎤 Practice mock interviews with friends or mentors. The more you practice, the more confident you’ll become.5️⃣ Stay Persistent: 💪 Rejections are part of the process. Don’t let them discourage you. Each \"no\" brings you closer to a \"yes.\"Think about Thomas Edison, who failed over 1,000 times before inventing the lightbulb. Each failure brought him one step closer to success. The same applies to you—every step you take, every new skill you learn, and every connection you make brings you closer to your goal.The right opportunity will come your way if you stay determined.🔑 Remember, every step you take is progress.

Wrong. When asked by AI tools like ChatGPT and LLaMA3, which is greater, 9.11 or 9.9, initially both answered that 9.11 is the greater. So how can AI, which is supposed to solve complex calculus problems fail at a basic second-grade maths question? The answer comes down to one word: tokenization.In the world of AI, tokenization refers to the process of breaking input text into smaller units called \"tokens.\" For example, the sentence \"I love food\" gets broken down into \"I,\" \"love,\" and \"food\". This helps AI understand human language without losing context or meaning—though this case is an exception. The reason why it fails here is that, in some instances, all numbers after the decimal point are treated as one unit, resulting in comparing 9. “11” to 9. “9” and giving an incorrect answer.The good news is that AI models continuously improve through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For example, as of today, ChatGPT has corrected its mistake and now accurately identifies \\'9.9 as greater than 9.11\\'(see attached screenshot from yesterday where it mistakenly stated that \\'9.11 is greater than 9.9\\'). However, Meta\\'s AI \"LLaMA\" still incorrectly shows \\'9.11 as greater than 9.9\\'. Even though RLHF helps AI models to correct their mistakes, at the core, they still rely on pattern recognition and data processing, thus lacking true understanding and critical thinking.In conclusion, always double check your math results even if it\\'s from an AI.hashtag#ai hashtag#tech hashtag#generativeai hashtag#llm\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 277853), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

But very few of these stories come to the surface.Let's start with Kunal Shah.> At just 15, Kunal's family faced a severe financial crisis.> This early setback became his driving force later on in his life.> In 2010, and Kunal co-founded Freecharge, a digital marketplace for bill payments.> Despite initial success and raising $120 million, Kunal sold Freecharge to Snapdeal in 2015 for $400 million.> But the real twisted when Freecharge's value plummeted to $45-70 million just over two years later on.Does this make Freecharge a failure? Not for Kunal. He said in an interview that he used Freecharge lessons to start CRED. It's now one of India's most valuable fintech startups, with 1484 cr revenue in FY23.The second entrepreneur I find less talked about in positive sense is: Vijay Shekhar Sharma.> Vijay's story begins as a young man from a small town.> He struggled with the English language at Delhi College of Engineering.> He skipped classes, lived in hostels, and often did not even eat anything.> He started XS Communications but lost 40% of his initial $10,000 funding.Vijay persevered despite the early failures and still pitched the idea for Paytm while his board was skeptical.Undeterred, he took a personal financial risk. Later, Paytm became a constant in India's digital payment landscape.Even though Paytm got into regulatory challenges and Freecharge went bust, what I learned from these stories is the power of sheer determination. These two entrepreneurs didn't just bounce back from failure; they used it as a springboard to even greater success.I think it's the ultimate test for an entrepreneur.

Placements & Interviews: Having a good CGPA can help you get through the door in campus placements. Many companies use it as a way to shortlist candidates for interviews. It shows your consistency and discipline, giving employers an idea of your academic capabilities. Aim for a CGPA between 7.5 to 8.5, but if it's above 8.5, even better – you'll have access to a lot of companies!If you want to have better clarity on CGPA for campus placements, do ask your seniors about the past placement scenario.2. Higher Education: If you're thinking about further studies, whether in India or abroad, your CGPA is important. Universities often have a minimum CGPA requirement, and a strong academic record can make it easier to get into the program you want and even secure scholarships.Scholarships play a crucial part when applying for foreign universities, and you need financial aid.3. College Life: But remember, your CGPA isn't everything. Getting involved in extracurricular activities, making connections, and gaining practical experience are just as important. These experiences help shape your personality, improve your soft skills, and prepare you for the real world.4. Balance is Key: Find the right balance between academics and personal growth. It's important to enjoy college life, make friends, and explore new things. A well-rounded approach will not only make your college life great but will also prepare you for a successful career.So, while your CGPA can open doors, it's the mix of knowledge, experience, and skills that will take you to great places!And don't forget to have fun in college – it's all about making lifelong memories and discovering new things!Follow Krishan Kumar for more!!hashtag#collegelife\\n\", 'href_map': {'Krishan Kumar': '/in/krishan-kumar08/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 333455), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

They:• create misunderstandings,• damage relationships,• and even destroy your career or business goals.1. Assuming Instead of AskingThe Mistake: We often assume others have the same context or understanding as we do.The Cost:• Misunderstandings,• missed opportunities,• and damaged relationships.The Fix: Over-communicate. Ask clarifying questions. Remember, assumptions are the termites of relationships.Example: Instead of assuming a colleague is upset with you, ask, \"I noticed you\\'ve been quiet lately. Is everything okay?\"2. Listening to Respond, Not to UnderstandThe Mistake: Formulating your response while the other person is still speaking.The Cost: Missing important information and making the other person feel unheard.The Fix:• Practice active listening.• Focus entirely on the speaker.• Paraphrase to ensure understanding.Tip: Try the 80/20 rule - listen 80% of the time, speak 20%.3. Neglecting Non-Verbal CommunicationThe Mistake: Focusing solely on words and ignoring body language, tone, and facial expressions.The Cost: Missing the full message and sending unintended signals.The Fix: Pay attention to your own body language and learn to read others\\'. Actions often speak louder than words.Fact: Studies show that up to 93% of communication is non-verbal.Lucky for us, good communication is a skill that can be learned and improved.It just requires constant practice and self-awareness.---Did you know that miscommunication can cost a company of 100 employees around $420,000 per year?I\\'m offering a FREE, no-strings-attached consultation about insights and strategies for improvement that helped 87% of my clients reduce miscommunication.Book your slot here: https://lnkd.in/ggs6uWyv---\\n', 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/ggs6uWyv': 'https://lnkd.in/ggs6uWyv'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 344835), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

The client(browser) gets the html javascripts and starts rendering the page by fetching the required components. This is generally called client-side rendering. But, this has a lot of issues with it so a lot of websites shift towards server-side rendering.1. Server Side Rendering(SSR) is a technique used to improve the performance of JavaScript templating systems (such as React). Rather than waiting for the client to download a JavaScript bundle and render the page based on its contents, we render the page’s HTML on the server side and attach dynamic hooks on the client side once it’s been downloaded.2. Let’s take an example of how yelp does this. Yelp prepares components for SSR by bundling them with an entrypoint function and any other dependencies into a self-contained .js file. The entrypoint then uses ReactDOMServer, which accepts component props and produces rendered HTML. These SSR bundles are uploaded to S3.3. On startup, yelp followed a strategy in which they would download and initialize the latest version of every SSR bundle for each page and then according to the request from the user the page would be loaded.4. But, this posed a lots of issues: 1. Downloading and initializing every bundle significantly increased service startup time, which made it difficult to quickly react to scaling events. 2. Having the service manage all bundles created a massive memory requirement. Every time a new instance came up, memory equal to sum of all bundles would have to be allocated. 3. If a new version of a bundle was uploaded in between service restarts, the service wouldn’t have a copy of it. 5. The above problems are quite common problems if you are doing server-side rendering for your websites. To solve the above problems, Yelp followed the following strategy: 1.\\xa0Shard service instances by bundle, so that each bundle has its own unique resource allocation. This reduces our overall resource footprint and makes bundle-specific performance easier to observe. 2.\\xa0Use an LRU cache to ensure too many dynamic bundles were not present in memory at the same time. 3. Be able to fast-fail requests which is not anticipated to be served quickly. If it is known that it’ll take a long time to render a request, the system should immediately fall back to client-side rendering.For more tech content: https://lnkd.in/gz_M6yrf\\n', 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/gz_M6yrf': 'https://lnkd.in/gz_M6yrf'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 365046), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Give it a read. [Download the Handbook] 👇Docker was born out of the frustration with the 'works on my machine' problem. 😀Developers often faced issues where applications worked perfectly fine on their local environments but failed when deployed to different servers or environments.This was due to inconsistencies in underlying operating systems, libraries and dependencies.Docker aimed to solve this by providing a standardized way to package and distribute applications with all their dependencies.Docker was first released as an open-source project in March 2013 by Solomon Hykes and the team at dotCloud (later renamed Docker, Inc.).The initial development of Docker took place in France as an internal project within dotCloud.It was then publicly introduced at PyCon in Santa Clara, California, in 2013.📌 What is Docker?◾ Docker is a platform that utilizes containerization technology to simplify the development, deployment and management of applications.◾ It has actually become a fundamental tool in modern software development, enabling faster development cycles, improved collaboration and easier scaling of applications.📌 5 facts that you should know about Docker.1/ PortabilityDocker packages your application and its environment into a single image, runnable on any machine with Docker installed.No more 'works on my machine' problems! 😉2/ EfficiencyDocker containers are lightweight and share system resources.This means you can run more applications on the same hardware.3/ Microservice FriendlyDocker is ideal for breaking down applications into smaller, independent components (microservices).This makes development and updates faster and more flexible.4/ Loves DevelopersDocker streamlines development, making setup quick and eliminating environment conflicts between developers and production.5/ Scaling Made EasyDocker works hand-in-hand with orchestration tools like Kubernetes, allowing you to manage and scale complex applications across multiple servers effortlessly.hashtag#docker hashtag#containers hashtag#vm hashtag#technology hashtag#softwaredevelopment\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 377314), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Secondly, the US economy was on the decline while India was booming. “I was also very much inspired by Abdul Kalam Sir, and my father who often quoted the phrase, ‘Janani janmabhoomishacha swargadapi gariyasi’”.

But what exactly are they, and how can we navigate through this tough phase?What Are Silent Layoffs?Silent layoffs occur when companies gradually reduce their workforce without making public announcements. This can happen through various means:- Reduced Hours: Your work hours are cut back without any clear reason.- No New Projects: You stop getting assigned new tasks or projects.- Isolation: You notice you’re left out of important meetings and decisions.- Performance Pressure: Unreasonable targets are set, making it hard to meet expectations.How to Overcome Silent Layoffs1. Acknowledge Your Feelings: It’s okay to feel lost, hurt, or anxious. This is a tough situation, but remember, you are not alone.2. Self-Reflection: Take a step back and assess your skills and achievements. What have you accomplished so far? This can boost your confidence.3. Upgrade Your Skills: Use this time to learn new things. There are many free online courses available that can help you upskill.4. Network: Connect with peers and professionals in your industry. Attend virtual events and join LinkedIn groups.5. Seek Support: Don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Talk to friends, family, or a career coach. Mental health is crucial during such times.6. Stay Positive: Remember, this phase doesn’t define your worth. Every setback is a setup for a comeback. Believe in yourself and stay resilient.Silent layoffs are a challenging experience, but they are just a phase. There is nothing wrong with you. It’s the market, not your capabilities.Keep pushing forward, stay connected, and continue to grow.

It emphasizes that interfaces should be small, specific, and focused on particular responsibilities. Classes should not be forced to implement methods they do not need.Key Idea:Avoid \"fat\" interfaces. Instead of creating large, all-encompassing interfaces, divide them into smaller, more specialized ones.Example:A multifunction printer interface that combines printing, scanning, faxing, and copying into one interface would violate ISP. Instead, separate interfaces for each function should be created so that a basic printer doesn’t have to implement unnecessary methods.\\n', 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/gpmBedcN': 'https://lnkd.in/gpmBedcN'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 411232), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

Re-sharing for those applying in this admissions cycle. I got admission to the University of Oxford not once, but twice. The first time, I did not get to go due to lack of funding, and unfortunately, had to withdraw my applications. The second time round, I was fortunate to receive two full scholarships - the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Trust Scholarship and the Chevening Awards Scholarship to study at Oxford. So, what are the lessons from my experience of securing a scholarship at Oxford? How did I change my strategy between the first (unsuccessful) attempt and the second (successful) attempt at securing admission and two scholarships at Oxford?\\xa0Here are four lessons: a) 𝗔𝗻 𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀 – in my second application cycle, I prioritised scholarships. This meant spending significantly more time in searching for and applying to scholarships. Scholarships were no longer the secondary (or last-minute) application to be considered after securing admission to the course. I thought about them in parallel and also prioritised the course based on the funding that could be secured. b) 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 – in my first application cycle, I had only applied to a few full scholarships, but in the second instance, I cast a wider net. I applied for smaller scholarship amounts which I knew would not cover the entire course fees but would help cover some of it. Smaller scholarships also gave me practice in developing answers and preparing for the interviews of the full scholarships. c) 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 – in my second application cycle, I prepared a broader calendar marking the important scholarship deadlines and updated a weekly planner that had detailed tasks for the next scholarship deadline. This helped have a sense of the broader picture of deadlines, while focussing more sharply on the detailed documentation to be fulfilled for each scholarship. This also helped to keep a track of deadline extensions, and new funding opportunities. d) 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 – in my second application cycle, I focussed more keenly on the ask of each scholarship-granting institution. Each scholarship has its own principles and values and will tend to award the candidates who embody them. For instance, some scholarships may be focussed on academic merit, while others may emphasise upon leadership skills. I calibrated the essays for each scholarship accordingly – I scouring the websites of scholarships, stressed upon key words, and made sure that my essays addressed the questions being posed by the scholarship bodies.

Recognizing this difference can reduce self-criticism and challenge negative thoughts.By identifying facts, you can reframe your opinions to be more balanced and supportive.For example, instead of thinking \"I’ll never be happy,\" you could focus on facts like \"I’ve had difficult times before, but I’ve also had happy moments.\"Separating facts from opinions can help you focus on reality, reduce negative self-talk, and foster a healthier mindset.\\n', 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 413951), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

AI Python for Beginners is a series of four short courses that teach anyone to code, regardless of current technical skill. We are offering these courses free for a limited time.Generative AI is transforming coding. This course teaches coding in a way that’s aligned with where the field is going, rather than where it has been:(1) AI as a Coding Companion: Experienced coders are using AI to help write snippets of code, debug code, and the like. We embrace this approach and describe best-practices for coding with a chatbot. Throughout the course, you'll have access to an AI chatbot that will be your own coding companion that can assist you every step of the way as you code.(2) Learning by Building AI Applications: You'll write code that interacts with large language models to quickly create fun applications to customize poems, write recipes, and manage a to-do list. This hands-on approach helps you see how writing code that calls on powerful AI models will make you more effective in your work and personal projects.With this approach, beginning programmers can learn to do useful things with code far faster than they could have even a year ago.Knowing a little bit of coding is increasingly helping people in job roles other than software engineers. For example, I've seen a marketing professional write code to download web pages and use generative AI to derive insights; a reporter write code to flag important stories; and an investor automate the initial drafts of contracts.With this course you’ll be equipped to automate repetitive tasks, analyze data more efficiently, and leverage AI to enhance your productivity.If you are already an experienced developer, please help me spread the word and encourage your non-developer friends to learn a little bit of coding.I hope you'll check out the first two short courses here! https://lnkd.in/g7VB9t2P\\n\", 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/g7VB9t2P': 'https://lnkd.in/g7VB9t2P'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 432287), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

I thought about it, so I put together a system design to help him visualize how it could be done with a better approach.I've divided the quiz app into three main types:1. Offline Mode: Using a SQLite database or even a simple JSON file.2. Online Mode: Leveraging an online database like MongoDB, Supabase, or similar.3. Quiz app with create feature with leaderboard: A quiz app that allows users to create quizzes with a live leaderboardThe primary idea behind this system is to efficiently manage quiz data. Whether the quiz is sourced online or user-generated, the system caches the quiz data to minimize repeated API calls. For instance, if there are 10 quiz sets within a particular category, the system stores them in a cache, serving them randomly to users without having to fetch them again and again. This not only optimizes performance but also enhances the user experience. Of course, this can be adjusted based on specific needs and use cases.This design is outlined in three main approaches to offer flexibility in how the app can be developed. While a quiz app might sound simple, there’s a lot of potential to make it a robust and scalable project. I also considered ideas like implementing a multiplayer mode, but for someone in their second year, it might be a bit too advanced at this stage, so I set that aside for now.I’d love to hear any thoughts or additional ideas on this. I didn’t incorporate load balancers directly, but you can certainly scale your database across multiple shards if needed.\\n\", 'href_map': {}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 432994), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

I arrived at the pickup point at 8:55 AM, giving myself ample time. However, the driver never showed up at the designated spot. Instead, he drove directly onto the highway, completely ignoring my pickup.When I tried calling the driver, his responses were minimal and unprofessional—he barely spoke, and when he did, it was a nonchalant “hmm” or “haa.” To make matters worse, his tone made me suspect he might have been intoxicated, which is extremely concerning.This incident is not an isolated one. It’s the third time this has happened, leaving me stranded and unable to rely on Uber Shuttle for my commute. What makes it worse is the lack of accessible customer support to address these issues. I’ve tried reaching out, but there seems to be no effective way to get in touch with Uber’s customer service.Why does this matter?As a loyal customer, I expect reliability, professionalism, and a way to voice concerns when things go wrong. The repeated failure to meet these basic expectations is frustrating, to say the least.I’m sharing this experience not just to vent, but to highlight the importance of accountability and proper customer service.

The cost was non-trivial, but the bigger problem was that most of the spending was wasted.The function performed a CPU-intensive task, so the team gave it the full 10GB of memory, hoping to boost its performance.But this was a Node.js function.As Node.js is single threaded, it only uses 1 CPU core unless you spawn child processes. So the client wasn't utilizing the 6 vCPUs that they got from the 10GB memory allocation.The workload didn't need all that memory either, so most of what they paid for was wasted.It's an innocent mistake and one that's far less common than underpowered functions, but it was very impactful.Lambda gives you a single lever to control performance and cost. I like the simplicity of it, more memory = more CPU. But it's also easy to get things wrong by an order of magnitude, and sometimes you just need more CPU without all the extra memory too.Before you rage against serverless, this costly, one-liner config mistake can also happen to container workloads.A misconfigured instance size or min auto-scaling count would do just much damage. At least the cost here is tied to the actual usage (it's a fairly busy function) and not idle servers doing nothing. I've worked in places that easily spent $10,000+/month for dev servers that averaged 5% CPU...Luckily, there are tools to address this kind of problem, but you still need to know about and use them.There's the Lambda Powertuning tool, which requires some effort on your part to proactively tune every function.There's also the AWS Compute Optimizer, which you can just opt-in to receive recommendations. But it might take a while to get recommendations because Compute Optimizer only shares recommendations when it has high confidence in them.But to complicate things, if you have a Lambdalith, then these optimizers also don't work very well, because your function can do many different things and exhibit drastically different performance characteristics.

The problem? We were at least a month away from getting it all done, and the codebase was a spaghetti mess. I knew we had a choice: patch it up and pray, or address the core issues with a strategic rebuild.After a quick assessment, I realized the existing architecture lacked modularity, making even simple updates risky. To add to the complexity, the team was geographically dispersed, each person working in silos. It was a classic fullstack nightmare.🚀 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜 𝗧𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝘁:𝗥𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲: I didn’t just dive in. I took a step back to prioritize the most business-critical features while identifying non-essentials that could be delayed or scaled down.𝗥𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: I advocated for a quick refactor of the architecture, focusing on separation of concerns. Implementing a more modular structure gave us flexibility and reduced future tech debt.𝗖𝗼𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: I established tighter sync-ups with the team—daily standups and continuous documentation. This helped us reduce misunderstandings and align on our priorities.𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: We didn’t have time for manual testing. I introduced CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and streamlined deployments, freeing us from firefighting regressions.💡 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: Not everything has to be perfect at launch, but what you do deliver should be rock-solid.𝗠𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗮𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲: A modular approach saved us countless hours, especially during tight iterations.𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗞𝗲𝘆: When working across distributed teams, over-communicating is better than assumptions.That experience taught me that sometimes the most critical skill in fullstack development isn\\'t about writing code—it\\'s about making smart decisions under pressure.What was your most memorable challenge as a developer, and how did you overcome it?

This means it can forecast the evolution and structure of storms with greater accuracy and speed than traditional methods, helping meteorologists track severe events like tornadoes and hurricanes. The model is part of NVIDIA's Earth-2 platform, which combines AI, physical simulations, and computer graphics to create a digital twin of the planet that can simulate and visualize weather and climate predictions at a global scale. With StormCast, researchers can predict future outcomes based on past ones, enabling more reliable disaster planning and mitigation. This breakthrough is part of a larger effort to use AI and accelerated computing to improve climate research and prediction, which is crucial for saving lives and reducing the impact of extreme weather events that cause over $150 billion in damage annually in the US alone.Source 🔗: https://lnkd.in/grVj_umTCurated with ❤️ via https://lnkd.in/dAQMAegz, aggregating 150+ hashtag#tech blogs on a single feed! ✨Subscribe to Techflix Daily: https://lnkd.in/gDnfiRrb\\n\", 'href_map': {'https://lnkd.in/grVj_umT': 'https://lnkd.in/grVj_umT', 'https://lnkd.in/dAQMAegz': 'https://lnkd.in/dAQMAegz', 'https://lnkd.in/gDnfiRrb': 'https://lnkd.in/gDnfiRrb'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 447139), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

But I was just trying to stay afloat.I took courses, practised like crazy, and tried to master those mysterious spreadsheets.But then, a lightbulb moment hit me-I was more excited about how the Excel pros created their tutorial videos than Excel tips itself!That’s when I discovered my passion for video creation and scriptwriting.Just like each Excel grid in a spreadsheet tells a statistic, each word in a script forms a story.And like Excel sheets record data, video scripts record my experiences.Transitions, filters, colour grading, writing a hook and finding the right catchphrase - content creation turned out to be as technical as consulting was!The big lesson?Everything is as hard as you want it to be.Don’t chase easy or hard, chase what makes you happy.Because when you are happy consultancy feels easy and when you are unhappy, content creation feels difficult.What is your dream job?

Just like in chess, where each move has a purpose and strategy, Git commands are the tactical decisions that shape your code’s journey.🔍 **`git status`**: Analyze your current board position. Know where you stand before making your next move.🔄 **`git commit`**: Make your move! Each commit is a deliberate step towards your goal.🌱 **`git branch`**: Explore different strategies without altering the main game. Branching lets you test new ideas safely.🎯 **`git merge`**: Combine strategies for a stronger game plan. Merge your best ideas back into the main branch.⏪ **`git reset`**: Undo a move that didn’t work out. Learn, adapt, and keep improving.By thinking of Git as a chess game, we can approach coding with the same strategic mindset that chess players use. Every command is a move that gets you closer to the perfect checkmate—the successful deployment of your project!How do you strategically use Git in your workflow?

I was rejected in so many companies, and what’s even more painful is that in several of them, I got rejected in the final round—whether it was a managerial round, a CTO round, or even by a co-founder.The feeling of getting so close, only to be turned down, is something I know all too well.But every rejection brought with it a valuable lesson, a piece of insight that I could carry forward. And it was these learnings that led me to topmate.io.I decided to come on topmate.io to share what I’ve learned with others who might be going through the same struggles. Over time, I’ve invented numerous hacks—ways to get interview calls, strategies for getting your resume shortlisted, and techniques for navigating the tough interview landscape. Whenever I get a call on topmate.io, I feel genuinely excited because I know I’ll be sharing these insights and potentially helping someone turn their rejection into an opportunity.But let me tell you about the real heroes behind my journey—my parents. During my rejection phase, they were the ones holding me up. Every time I got rejected, they were there, motivating me, mentoring me, and guiding me back on track. Their support was unwavering, and without them, I wouldn’t be where I am today.So, this post is a thank you—to my parents for their endless support, and to everyone who has been part of my journey. And if my experiences resonate with you, I’m hashtag#BeAvailable to share more on topmate.io.Thank you, Mom and Dad, for always being my rock. 🙏hashtag#BeAvailable topmate.io hashtag#grateful hashtag#job hashtag#success hashtag#rejections hashtag#topmate hashtag#gratitute hashtag#parents hashtag#flipkart\\n\", 'href_map': {'topmate.io': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/topmate-io/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 463237), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

For example, instead of typing `git status`, you can create an alias like `gs` to quickly check the status of your repository. 🛠️ Add aliases to your `.gitconfig` file for a more efficient workflow. ``` git config --global alias.gs status git config --global alias.co checkout ```2️⃣ Interactive Add: Want to stage changes selectively? Use `git add -p` (or `git add --patch`) to interactively choose which changes to stage. This is perfect for splitting changes into multiple commits and keeping your history clean. 📦 ``` git add -p ```3️⃣ Stash: Need to switch branches but have uncommitted changes? Use `git stash` to save your changes temporarily. When you’re ready, apply the stash with `git stash apply` to bring your changes back. It’s a lifesaver for managing work-in-progress! 🌟 ``` git stash git stash apply ```4️⃣ Rebase: Keep your commits organized and your history clean with `git rebase`. Rebase allows you to apply commits from one branch onto another, making your feature branches easier to manage and integrate. Remember to use `rebase` carefully to avoid conflicts. 🧩 ``` git rebase main ```By incorporating these Git tips into your workflow, you’ll streamline your development process and maintain a cleaner codebase. 💪Got any favorite Git tips or tricks?

Step Up Social originally started as a TikTok-only agency, making TikToks while Instagram wasn’t pushing Reels and YouTube Shorts weren’t even a thing yet. Short-form content was not super popular, and it wasn’t being prioritized. At that time, TikTok marketing was a nice-to-have, something brands only considered if they happened to have extra marketing budget. We were like a vitamin or a supplement to potential clients - nice to have but not really a necessity.But then, the algorithms got flipped upside down, and the landscape of social media practically changed overnight. Instagram started to push and prioritize Reels, and YouTube came out with Shorts. We evolved from being just a TikTok agency to a full-suite social media management company. Suddenly, we didn’t just do TikToks; we did Instagram Reels, Meta Reels and YouTube Shorts. We went back and revisited clients who had previously said no to our “just TikTok” offerings, and the many of them changed their minds.We had already been doing short-form content for such a long time. This seemingly simple social media algorithm change transformed us from a “vitamin” into a “painkiller,” making our services essential for any business who wanted to get reach on social platforms.Did we know that social media platforms would make this change? Nope. But we were incredibly well-positioned for it since we already had a great portfolio of short-form content and the clientele to prove it. You could say we were in the right place at the right time or that we had good foresight.But at the end of the day, working in the social media space means being beholden to the whims and changes of the major social media platforms. Always be ready to adapt and pivot quickly. 🚀**Key Takeaway:** Adaptability and seizing new opportunities can transform your business from a nice-to-have service into a must-have solution.\\n', 'href_map': {'Step Up Social': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/stepupsocial/'}, 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 21, 15, 12, 35, 476263), 'status': 'pending'}\n",

One powerful way to differentiate yourself is to solve in public. Share your learning journey, challenges, and growth on platforms like GitHub and Twitter (especially if you're into development). Don't just post code, explain your approach, your understanding, and the lessons learned along the way. Also, use LinkedIn to showcase your projects and experiences. This isn't just about getting likes, it's about visibility and creating opportunities. The more you share, the more you increase your chances of being noticed by potential employers and collaborators.
